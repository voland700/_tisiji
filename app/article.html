<p>Air quality is important to us here at Morsø and we endeavour to provide our customers with the highest quality wood burners to ensure this. Our constant research and innovation has led to our developing stoves that are amongst the most efficient wood burning stoves in the world, making them a responsible heat source. Morsø’s wood-burning stoves meet some of the strictest environmental standards, including the Nordic Swan Eco Label. You can also be assured that Morsø are at the forefront of the EcoDesign 2022 standards that have been discussed in the UK press recently. A large of number of our stoves are also listed on the HETAS website as SIA EcoDesign ready with others to follow. We have demonstrably reduced the emissions of particles to an absolute minimum by using refined combustion technology together with an advanced purification system.</p>

<p>We also produce a large number of stoves that can currently be fitted in UK smoke-free zones. These produce a clean burn with very low emissions.

<p>On the one side, there’s talk about CO2 and global warming. On the other, there’s the recurring debate about soot, which, along with harmless water vapour, is contained in the smoke emitted from any wood-burning stove.</p>

<p>Being environmentally friendly isn’t just about reducing carbon dioxide emissions. There is an ongoing debate about soot which, together with water vapour, makes up the smoke emitted from any wood burning stove.</p>

<p>When we develop our wood burners, we always do so from an eco-friendly point of view.</p>

<p>Modern Morsø stoves, if used correctly, are among the most efficient wood burning stoves in the world. And we can prove it. We have demonstrably reduced the emission of particles to an absolute minimum using refined combustion technology and advanced purification systems.</p>

<p>We make a wide range of DEFRA-approved wood burning stoves for use in smoke-free zones. They adhere to the strict requirements of the Clean Air Act 1993.</p>

Morsø’s wood-burning stoves meet some of the strictest environmental standards in the world. In particular, they meet Norwegian Standard NS 3058/3059, which sets out stringent requirements on minimising particle emissions.</p>

Most Morsø wood burning stoves are certified by the Nordic Swan Eco-label. This not only highlights the stove’s minimal impact on the environment when operating, it also highlights the minimal environmental impact caused by the actual production and packaging too.</p>


Our stoves are also tested for low particle emissions in the USA and Austria.</p>

All our wood burning stoves comply with European Standard EN 13 240, which means that they are CE-marked. </p>
